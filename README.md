# Zot

> A Node / React, package based CMS framework.

Inspired by legendary open-source content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Django - Zot focuses on modern design, engineering, and distribution.

# The Plan

Zot is under core development but will become a "monorepo" distributing packages that can be used individually or as a whole to run a web based content management system. Packages will include themes, components, sample app/s, APIs (REST, GraphQL), themes, components and more.

#### Components and Theming

Zot will include a base theme and set of components, but it will also establish a means for contributors to extend or replace in implementation. This model is similar to the WordPress theme and plugin contribution model. Zot will be a "universal" React, Node web application with documentation and a styleguide to drive modern open-source collaboration to an awesome end product.
